"Layout Miami" is a project where you will implement a landing page based on a chosen design. The goal of the task is to create a simple and visually appealing landing page by following video lessons. The project encourages focusing on simplicity and layout structure, rather than striving for pixel-perfect accuracy.

### Key features:
- **Page blocks**: Implement different blocks of the landing page, following the design in a simple way.
- **Implementation**: Follow the video lessons and create the page elements without aiming for pixel-perfect precision, focusing on simplicity.
- **Deployment**: Each completed block is deployed and submitted as a demo link via a Pull Request.
- **Progressive development**: After each block, changes are committed, pushed, and the demo is updated.

### Additional features:
- **Mobile responsiveness**: The layout is designed to be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.
- **Minimalistic design**: Focus on simplicity, replicating the look and feel of the original design without worrying about exact measurements.
- **Project structure**: Each section is implemented separately and deployed individually for easy review.
